#Enabling SSH in Headless PI
To enable SSH, you need to place an empty file named ssh (no extension) in the root of the boot disk.
Or use window command prompt-->CD to the boot drive of pi (after writing the Noobs/Raspbian image; smalled partition is boot drive)--> Execute type NUL >> ssh--> confirm ssh is created
You can use Notepad++ to create ssh as well.

#Setting WiFi Info on Headless Pi
Using Notepad++ (with EOL set for Unix) create a file in the root of boot called: wpa_supplicant.conf

country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="NETWORK-NAME"
    psk="NETWORK-PASSWORD"
}

Once you are able to login to Pi via ssh (default user is pi with a password of raspberry) you can change the password with below commands:

sudo raspi-config
